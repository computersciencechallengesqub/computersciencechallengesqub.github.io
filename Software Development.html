There are many forces making it difficult to commercialise software products including: widespread piracy, predatory plagiarising rivals, powerful free open source alternatives, companies like Google offering polished free alternatives in exchange for user data. Similarly, the distrust from customers has grown, driven by virus/adware, spyware, predatory monetisation, lock-in, security breaches, usability failures and more. To create a viable software-based business requires addressing all of these issues and more. For the lucky few, particularly those that create stable, subscription based software (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Blizzard), enormous financial success can be obtained. This success is not exclusive to large firms and many software businesses start by providing niche products to companies and communities. Rent-seeking monopolies are often the most profitable business models but they are generally bad for customers. Organisations seek to lock-in users to their applications, operating systems, development platforms, languages etc. so that they can minimise competition, maximise the value of their own knowledge/products and increase incentives for users to pay for features and services. This has lead to an endless churn of developers abandoning bloated unstable frameworks whose lockin undermines the use of modern functionality/techniques. Developers switch to leaner alternatives, directly designed for new technologies, only to see the new alternatives become bloated and unstable in turn.</p><p id="bb21dcf7-0ccb-4e91-a761-6d9d16eceb3d" class="">This poses a challenge for developers wishing to create innovative products of lasting value. Thankfully, because of Turing Completeness, the underlying datastructures and algorithms that make applications function are not fundamentally dependent on any platform. Over the years those that have experienced the limitations of large frameworks have developed lean cross-platform alternatives and minimal libraries to enable powerful, high performance software to be rapidly developed and easily ported to many systems and technologies. As operating systems have become bloated and unstable, more and more application functionality is moving to cloud services that run on rented servers running minimal operating systems and virtualisation frameworks such as Docker. Many applications are now partially or fully cloud based and these carry many advantages in terms of piracy protection, patching and user monitoring/feedback. Modern technology companies tend to create products that span many platforms, particularly web and mobile and have relatively seamless integration. In addition, UI frameworks have tended towards excessive complexity and limited customisation, but with modern html, css and javascript an attractive user interface can be rapidly created and adapted. As with software frameworks, web frameworks (and HTML CSS and javascript) tend towards bloated, hard to debug unstable platforms with lockin. However, alternatives exist and new technologies, such as compiling other languages to javascript (Emscripten) enables high performance innovative web applications with advanced functionality. For example, 3d graphics, VR, AR, deep learning, etc.</p><p id="7768eb99-2f17-4b61-a486-74cff038f870" class="">PC, mobile and web technology, can be developed within many of the challenge areas. However, this area is focused on the creation of libraries, tools and example code to enable others to easily create high quality applications with advanced functionality. It is less about making a specific product and more about making it easier for others to make innovative software.</p><p id="ea997651-4e2c-4bd1-9117-52d735967b5a" class="">Innovation areas for application development:</p><h3 id="94f41380-6b10-4180-8d86-bd7938be556e" class="">A. Cross platform (and platform version/capability), high performance, high functionality software</h3><p id="a741d1c8-2e40-42eb-991b-742d9d376691" class="">i) Cross language LLVM is the common backend for many programming language compilers. More recently LLVM has been used to convert computer code into optimised javascript to create powerful client side web applications. Create a system for producing source code in different languages from LLVM‚Äôs internal abstract syntax tree representation (known as IR). Use keyword functions to generate language specific functionality such as windowing systems/ file access etc. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19385878/converting-llvm-ir-to-other-language-code). The goal of such a system is to enable the creation of debuggable, understandable libraries that can be used with all popular languages (and to assist with the porting of existing code between languages).</p><p id="353ccfbb-ab4a-4d64-b61a-54e00c6d7067" class="">ii) Native high-quality experiences on each platform Applications that enable the use of features specific to a given platform. For example, always on top windows, dockable/background applications, transparent windows etc. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4052940/how-to-make-an-opengl-rendering-context-with-transparent-background). To enable cross platform functionality, people often use scripting or byte code based languages. For high performance applications, such as computer games, it is more common to have a preprocessor create native code and build files for each platform. The preprocessor enables specialist native code to be embedded in the codebase. This also enables the use of platform specific debugging tools. The goal of this project is to make a preprocessor for IOS, Android, Windows and/or Linux that will create compilable projects using popular development tools for each platform e.g. Xcode, Android Studio, Visual Studio, GCC/Make enabling relatively easy native functionality and build tool usage not available on existing frameworks such as Flutter, Java etc.</p><p id="ea985bdb-ccaa-482c-9474-6a4b59a29882" class="">iii) Easy development on novel platforms Take a new platform and create an automated development tool that can be easily installed to enable developers who are learning to program to be able to create executables that run on both a PC and the new platform. For example Smart TV, Voice assistant, smart watch, VR (Oculus Go/Quest/Vive)</p><p id="1dd8084d-ba25-4394-a255-5f056c80141d" class="">iv) Supports a diverse range of input devices and display sizes/configurations, with abstracted interfaces on each platform Create a minimal example application that demonstrates how common game UI components such as 3D movement (of camera and object), menus and text data entry can be abstracted for cross interface software development. By abstracting the interface, have the same application code be able to use many different input platforms. Gamepads, VR controllers, hand trackers, ipad, ipencil, mobile phone, smart watch, smart TV etc. (design how all the interfaces might work but only implement your favourite that you have time to develop)</p><p id="5141dc01-8076-4f65-b590-5c5d490541c5" class="">v) Multi-screen applications - Interface on one platform that can control software on another Such as the Nvidia shield mobile app and Smart TV. Create a minimal example project that others can build on, that uses network communication between programs installed on mulitple devices such that a developer can easily make use of remote screens and interfaces as if they were all on the same device. For example local and remote openGL windows or local and remote HTML ui components.</p><p id="91a029a5-7a47-4ef7-b96b-25b155a02834" class="">vi) Web apps as exes. Use wxwindows, android studio or xcode to create a minimal web browser application (using a webkit based web browser ui element) and a linked virtual machine (java, python or javascript) and an interface between them to enable webserver based web apps to be converted to self contained executables without needing to use a webserver or web browser.</p><p id="4deb6d87-c41e-4d38-b63c-51fc87ed8023" class="">vii) Photoreal virtual world internet interface. Adapt Unreal or Unity as a renderer for internet loaded content with a virtual machine based scripting engine e.g. java or python. So that a virtual world with dynamic content can be created like a web site (3D environment is like the HTML DOM, virtual machine is like javascript, actions in the world trigger new &#x27;pages&#x27; to be loaded). In the case of Unreal we have already made progress adapting it for dynamic loading of virtual assets and control of them in the world via a memory mapped file interface.</p><h3 id="d8887f9d-4540-470d-970d-672feb183d4e" class="">B. Respectful, convenient, polished, powerful software</h3><p id="dba86b8a-44bd-4b45-b495-1d05eed8d312" class="">i) Minimised time to usable state Create a packaging tool, library and example application that can be used to create applications with a large quantity of code and assets that are downloaded, decompressed and installed (and uninstalled if resources are limited) on demand. Ensure the initial application is small, downloads quickly, is self contained (no installation needed), launches virtually instantly, can be interactively used with a fixed size set of compressed assets and code. Will download extra functionality as needed in a background thread, starting with a minimal compressed version and seamlessly loading more functionality and assets as needed. Gracefully rolls back heavyweight code and assets as not needed.
